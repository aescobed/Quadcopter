should i be setting the MPU registers with SPI? 
	Need to set the AK registers with I2C anyways.
		Should i set the MPU registers with MPI then treat the AK as a slave to the MPU and interact with it using I2C from the MPU
		OR
		Should I communicate with both the MPU9250 and AK using I2C
			Either just for setting the registers or also for reading values


The MPU9250 never switches to I2C if initialized with SPI
	_useSPI never set to false
